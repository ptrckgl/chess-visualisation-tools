# Chess Visualisation Tools

- This repository contains tools to (maybe) improve Chess visualisation.
- It is made using Python3 and Pygame.
- Run the programs using 'Python3 program.py'
- For example, the idea of the square_location.py file is to train your ability to quickly locate squares, from both the white and black perspective. You are under a time limit, so try and locate as many squares as possible!
- Enjoy!
